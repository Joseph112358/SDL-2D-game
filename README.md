Welcome to my C++ SDL game!

Tl;dr: This is my 2D, SDL game loosely inspired by some of the Five Nights at Freddy's minigames 

Technology used
Written in C++ (Mingw compiler) with the SDL2 graphics library
Makefile used as a build tool
Most of development done using VS code.

Running the program (WIP)

Ideas (WIP): This is just for me to brainstorm what I want to implement some fun levels and features in the game

Level ideas, find the cake slices? -> 
-- Find all the different slices
-- as you find each one, a sprite in the middle completes itself
-- Once done, confetti + celebration, not enough slices for everyone
-- Player has to go to back room to find more -> level 2

Level 2 repair animatronics?

TODO:
Show score on UI
Detail room with chairs and tables,
Add NPC's
Create Level 2 once basic functionality is fleshed out more.
