Welcome to my C++ SDL game!

Tl;dr: This is my 2D, SDL game. I'm mainly just using it to learn and prototype concepts for now. I might choose
To implement / flesh out these ideas in a custom SDL game engine, or use an existing game engine such as Monogame or godot.

Technology used
Written in C++ (Mingw compiler) with the SDL2 graphics library
Makefile used as a build tool
Most of development done using VS code.

Running the program (WIP)
Either run the exe with the SDL2 dll or compile it yourself (exe not currently included)

Ideas (WIP): This is just for me to brainstorm what I want to implement some fun levels and features in the game

Level ideas, find the cake slices? -> 
-- Find all the different slices
-- as you find each one, a sprite in the middle completes itself
-- Once done, confetti + celebration, not enough slices for everyone
-- Player has to go to back room to find more -> level 2


TODO:
* Finish levels
* Create a main menu
* Detail room with chairs and tables,
* Add NPC's

Retrospective (WIP)

tl;dr I'm not going to develop this game much further, it was mainly a fun little project for me to learn SDL 2 with. That being said, I am going to start a new 2D game project, even bigger and better than this one, carrying over skills and lessons learnt from this project. The new game will include better windowing (fullscreen), better animations, plus a more fleshed out world (NPC's, sound, interactable objects, Shadows?ðŸ˜³?) giving the player greater agency.
